"Psychic", A Computer Game made with Javascript

In this game, you (the user) will be guessing a random alphabetical letter that the computer game (computer) has selected. To begin playing, press any letter to enter the game.

You get 9 chances to guess the computer's selected letter. 

Each time you guess incorrectly, your "guesses left" (total of 9) decrements by 1. If all the number of your guesses have been exhausted (ie. 0 guesses left), you lose the round and "losses" increments by 1.

Each time you guess the correct letter, you gain a win.

Good luck guessing!
